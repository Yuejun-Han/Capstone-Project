## Project Introduction

This project uses two deep learning algorithms, [Enformer](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/enformer) and [PredixCan](https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan#:~:text=PrediXcan%20is%20a%20gene%2Dbased,be%20causal%20for%20the%20phenotype.), to predict mRNA levels from DNA sequence data. These two models are very different from each other. PrediXcan is an approach that makes use of the reference transcriptome data sets to do statistical training of prediction based on the common gene variations in hundreds or thousands of individuals. This trained model is then employed to predict gene expression and to map trait-associated loci. Another approach is Enformer, which is developed upon a Neural Network architecture based on self-attention mechanism to predict gene expression at target chromosomes or specific tissues. Making predictions based on the DNA sequence only, this method is able to detect both known and unknown trait-associated variants. To learn more about them, you can also check out their article: [PrediXcan article](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3367), [Enformer article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01252-x)

## Project Goal

Our project objective is to use the developer-tuned version of the Enformer model and PrediXcan model to make gene expression predictions. We compare two modelsâ€™ performance on target genes across individuals from two populations: one group of individuals with African ancestry and the other with European ancestry. The input data is obtained from the publicly available [Geuvadis dataset](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/geuvadis), which contains gene expression measurements in LCL cell lines and DNA sequence data from more than 500 individuals across 5 different populations.
